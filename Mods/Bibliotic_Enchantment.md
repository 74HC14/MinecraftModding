## Bibliotic Enchantment

[Return](../)


#### Description:
Adds to vanilla enchantment aesthetics by expanding the book system. Adds multiple tiers of enchantment technology, which serve to improve the player’s control and efficiency with respect to enchantment, and improve the variety, power, and versatility of the enchantments themselves. Also a liquid XP system.

#### Tier 0: Control over Books - default vanilla enchantment

#### Tier 1: Control over Pages- requires a number of enchanted books
* every enchantment is made of a combination of words
* cut an enchanted book up into pages with individual words using the bibliotic table
* combine pages into enchanted books using bibliotic table, including custom enchantments
* bibliotic table is fuelled by player’s XP
* enchantment book of level N needs 2^N enchantment level 1 equivalents of words to create in bibliotic table
* enchanted book creation is still limited to anvil size limit (e.g. Efficiency V)
* pages can be stored in bulk in barrel-like racks
* pages in racks around an enchantment table put a bias onto enchantment RNG, more of X words nearby reduces chance of X word appearing
* pages in racks can be moved with pistons
* bibliotic table is limited to a certain number of pages
* cumulative work penalty disappears when books are disassembled
* store liquid XP just like OpenBlocks

#### Tier 2: Control over Words - requires curse enchantments
* enchanted books and pages can be dissolved into bibliotic soup in the word mill
* word mill can pull enchantments off tools into bibliotic soup
* bibliotic soup is stored in a large tank and connected to word mill and altar word injectors by pipes
* can combine words from soup into enchantments using the bibliotic altar, which then applies it to a tool, block, book, or entity placed in the target circle
* bibliotic altar is a multiblock where XP injectors limit the price of the enchantment, and word injectors limit the size of the enchantment, both need line of sight to bibliotic altar
* bibliotic altar has no power limit and can apply enchantments to an already enchanted item
* no work penalty
* bibliotic soup tanks can bias enchantment table even more strongly than racks of pages
* create wither cages with blast protection enchanted blocks
* automate mob killing and XP gathering with enchanted blocks that impersonate player kills
* still need to use a biased enchantment table to create new enchantments, but can automate this, probably enchanting and disenchanting gold tools.
* enchantments applied to entities are temporary, like beacon effects
* enchantments applied to entities can be permanent until death by using words from a curse of binding book
* enchant yourself with binding words for permanent beacon-like effects

#### Tier 3: Control over Meaning - requires enchanted blocks and treasure words
* mending books and notch apples contain regeneration words
* overfill a tank of bibliotic soup with regeneration words in it to get a bibliocreature
* bibliocreatures are large masses of words, look like a clump of word particles
* words can be harvested from bibliocreatures using inverted altar word injectors
* bibliocreatures regenerate lost words and grow larger by consuming XP
* the words within bibliocreatures impact their characteristics, for example:
* tool = will break nearby blocks
* weapon = will damage nearby mobs and players, causing them to drop XP
* arthropod = will climb walls
* bibliocreatures can absorb words from enchanted mobs or blocks or items that they eat
* bilbiocreatures increase in size in proportion to the new words that they eat
* bibliocreatures have a force that pulls in words and each other that increases with word mass
* bibliocreatures can merge together
* if a creature gains enough word mass it collapses into an information singularity after a short time and sucks all the meaning out of its surroundings in a large radius
* meaningless radius is dependant on original bibliocreature word mass
* meaningless blocks break easily by a player but are impervious to all bibliocreatures

#### Tier 4: Control over Nothing - requires bibliocreatures and meaningless blocks
* end-game singularity farming requires meaningless blocks and high-level enchanted blocks
* force gradient of singularity is less steep for larger singularities, so pumping large numbers of words into them before they collapse is a useful strategy
* a singularity will not evaporate until meaning flow has stopped, so you can keep feeding it words to keep it alive
* radius of meaninglessness does not increase (?)
* meaning particles are pulled out of normal blocks and sucked towards the singularity
* meaning particles can be turned into words when they get sucked through a bibliotic soup tank
* meaning from ordinary blocks vastly increases the vocabulary of words for unique enchantments

#### Use:
This is an extension of vanilla enchanting mechanics that doesn't significantly clash with vanilla aesthetics, while increasing the power level of vanilla items by a significant degree. The available tiers would be tweakable, hence this mod would be usable in a variety of modpacks, ranging from vanilla plus to high-power magic or magitech modpacks. It would be important to integrate modded enchantments into the system, probably by a json file to state what words any new enchantments contain.
