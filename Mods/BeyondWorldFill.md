## Beyond World Fill
[Return](../)
#### Description:
This mod is mainly an aesthetic mod, designed to make floating sky island maps and dimensions look better.
The sun appearing below the horizon at night, and an otherwise strange looking skybox, are what this mod aims to fix.
It also adds a few quality-of-life changes associated with beyond the world.
#### Features:
* fills below a configurable Y level (e.g. Y=0, Y=-64) with the appearance of a block/fluid/texture, but unbreakable, on a per-dimension basis
* can also fill above a configurable Y level
* flat colour for the horizon, intended to blend in with the block/fluid/texture when it is out of render distance
* option to block the sun, moon, and stars from appearing below the 0Â° horizon
* void fluids can be swum through
* optional ability to pick up buckets from fluid or use a pump machine
* adjustable death height and message for both below and above
#### Use:
This would be optimal for filling in the sky beneath a floating island map with water or clouds, or for putting lava beyond a bedrock floor/ceiling.
Would work well with [Void Elevators](../Mods/VoidElevators.md).
