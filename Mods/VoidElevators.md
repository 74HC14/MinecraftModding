## Void Elevators
#### Description:
This mod is a mod intended to provide alternative methods for travelling between dimensions, similarly to [Vertical Stacked Dimensions](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/vertically-stacked-dimensions).
This mod intends to make it easier to control dimension progression in a modpack without having to worry about what portal needs what material.
This mod intends to work with tech, magical, and vanilla-styled modpacks with a variety of aesthetics.
#### Features:
* configurable different tiers tools to dig through bedrock like drills, lasers, explosives, etc.
* constructable elevator multiblocks that can carry the player up and down the hole, with configurable movement speed and possible transitions
* different transitions can be configured to have different total lengths between them, requiring longer drills and elevator ropes/chains, and more time
* parachutes and balloons for one-way travel, with configurable heights they work at for each dimension
* adjustable travel ratios and dimension stack-ups
* elevators can be configured to be powered electrically, mechanically, with fluids, etc.
* various possible tech tiers of elevators, from ramshackle wooden to space-age hermetically sealed
* dynamic textures of items in order to appear made of key materials
* inside of holes appear made of a texture of choice stretching all the way down
#### Use:
This mod would be placed in a modpack with multiple dimensions and a desired progression between them.
