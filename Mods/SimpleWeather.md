## Simple Weather
[Return](../)
#### Description:
This mod is designed to be a lightweight local weather mod without all the bloat of tornado mods.
#### Features:
* wind, precipitation, and cloud cover all vary over time as functions of altitude, biome, and distance to mountain and ocean biomes
* possible weather includes rain, sun-showers, thunderstorms, snow, gusts, and fog, maybe hail and sleet
* weather doesn't just abruptly clear when a player sleeps the night away, the weather just skips forward in its time function
* rain fills up cauldrons, and open-air tanks and reservoirs proportionally to the amount of rainfall
* wind powers wind generators proportionally to wind speed
* cloud cover blocks solar generation proportionally to the density of cloud
* high wind can optionally blow particles of snow, leaves, and sand/dust blocks
* results in lightning hot-spots, reliable wind generation areas, and optimal water collection areas
* hail could damage crops
* wind speed and direction could blow entities about, but that feels like it might get laggy
* cool looking clouds maybe
* possibly adds seasons too, or is otherwise compatible with a mod like [Serene Seasons](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/serene-seasons)
#### Use:
This mod would both fit into a lightweight vanilla+ modpack, and augment a tech modpack to make its renewable generation more dynamic.
It would be recommended for a mod like [Hydropower Reservoirs](../Mods/HydropowerReservoirs.md).
