#### Hydropower Reservoirs
## Description:
This mod is a specialised tech mod intended to completely overhaul water power generation.
Conventional water generators are passive and unlimited by water supply, so they have to be balanced by making water generation comparatively weak, which this mod aims to solve. Enormous hydro-dams are encouraged
The mod is based around dynamic water reservoirs, similar to those in [Fancy Fluid Storage](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ffs-fancy-fluid-storage).
There are various aesthetics to suit tech levels in different modpacks.
## Features:
* reservoir is generated by placing outlet blocks in a hollow or lake in the ground
* reservoir acts as a large water tank, where water level is physically visible in the multiblock, can swim and drown
* reservoir collects water from rain if uncovered, optionally evaporates water in sunlight
* pipes are lead from outlet blocks down to sea-level water biome or over a void hole/cliff and fed into turbine multiblock
* sea level can be set per biome or per dimension
* turbine multiblock makes mechanical power that can be fed into an electrical generator multiblock, or both are integrated if there is no mechanical power
* torque and current are proportional to water head, while speed and voltage are proportional to flow-rate
* three main tech tiers, wooden paddle-wheel with bamboo pipes, metal cup-wheel with metal pipes, and axial turbines with large high-pressure pipes
* possibly can use water wheels and pipes from existing tech mods
* turbine in a water biome can be reversed to pump water back into a reservoir
* can pump water between two reservoirs
* adjustable losses from turbines, from generators, and from the length and size of pipes
* visual effect of water cascading out of turbine
* optional non-water rain configurable by dimension and biome
* you can just pipe the water directly into a lower tank if you don't want to generate energy from it
## Use:
It is intended to be used alongside other tech mods, after disabling their default water generators.
This mod is best used with a finite water biomes mod, like [Finite Water Control](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/finite-water-control), in order to make water an actually scarce resource.
This mod is best used with a weather mod, like [Simple Weather](../Mods/SimpleWeather.md), to make the positioning of a reservoir nontrivial.
